This idea hit me when I was in my 4th semester.
In 4th semester we have a language named Java.
I was unable to understand what my teacher taught us in the classroom.
So I thought to go for private tuition classes.
One of our college professor provide tuition classes.
But due to high demand seats were full for the tuition classes.
So I started searching another tuition. At that time I faced so much problems searching for a different tuition teacher.
In India to find a tuition teacher we have to ask other students, different differnet people.
It is not easy to find a good teacher in a single go. 
As we know every student is not equal.
Some students cannot learn in a group. They require personal care.

The Idea is:
I thought why there is no application that will provide us the details of all the tuition teachers around us for a particular subject.
It is just like the OYO app. Their will be ratings, reviews , fees, students studying per batch and etc etc.
This will improve the quality of eductaion in our society.
This will also give a chance to new teachers who want to provide tuition classes.
We also face many problems to find the place were the house or the building were the teacher is teaching.
So the app will also provide the location, pictures of the building or the sourroundings so that it will get easy to identify the actual place.

So you are thinking how it will improve the quality of the education..!!
Here how it will :
Because of this review or rating system in the app their will be a huge competition.
Due to this competition the teachers will try to provide the best possible way te teach the students.


For now thats all I have in my mind.
I don't know wether this idea has already been implemented or not. But I want to try this idea out.
